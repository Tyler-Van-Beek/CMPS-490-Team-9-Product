HOW TO INSTALL A VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT FOR THIS PROJECT

1. Install Anaconda - https://www.anaconda.com/download
   
2. In the installer, make sure to click "Add Anaconda3 to my PATH environment variable" tick. 
   
3. Finish installation
   
4. Open up a powershell (on Windows, right click the windows button on the bottom left of the screen then select "Command Prompt")
   
5. Type "conda --version" to see if the installation has worked. You should see something like "conda 24.9.2". If it does not show up, try installing again (remember step 2).

6. When that is verified, to create the virtual environment, type "conda create -n <name> python=3.10.0". Replace <name> with whatever you wish to name the environment.

7. Press "y" on your keyboard to proceed when prompted while the environment is created. 
   
8. The environment is now created. In the same command prompt, you can use "conda activate <name>" to turn it on and "conda deactivate" to turn it off.
CMPS 490 Project

For our local accessability we plan on using the run and debug feature on Visual Studio.
For our platform to help share, develope and locally run the code we will be using Visual Studio.
For our deployment we have decided to go with AWS since it is a easy and inexpensive resource with plenty of support.
For the front end we plan on using HTML5 and CSS# for up to date features and support with Django to manage frontend templates and to have a smooth backend transition.
For the back end we plan on using python for its versitility and easy of use and support.
For our Database we plan to self create data as a mockup of what possible data for this web application could be. As well as using SQLite as our database program
