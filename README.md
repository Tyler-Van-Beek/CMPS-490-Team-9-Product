CMPS 490 Project

For our local accessability we plan on using the run and debug feature on Visual Studio.
For our platform to help share, develope and locally run the code we will be using Visual Studio.
For our deployment we have decided to go with AWS since it is a easy and inexpensive resource with plenty of support.
For the front end we plan on using HTML5 and CSS# for up to date features and support with Django to manage frontend templates and to have a smooth backend transition.
For the back end we plan on using python for its versitility and easy of use and support.
For our Database we plan to self create data as a mockup of what possible data for this web application could be. As well as using SQLite as our database program
