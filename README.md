HOW TO INSTALL A VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT FOR THIS PROJECT

1. Install Anaconda - https://www.anaconda.com/download
   
2. In the installer, make sure to click "Add Anaconda3 to my PATH environment variable" tick. 
   
3. Finish installation
   
4. Open up a powershell (on Windows, right click the windows button on the bottom left of the screen then select "Command Prompt")
   
5. Type "conda --version" to see if the installation has worked. You should see something like "conda 24.9.2". If it does not show up, try installing again (remember step 2).

6. When that is verified, to create the virtual environment, type "conda create -n <name> python=3.10.0". Replace <name> with whatever you wish to name the environment.

7. Press "y" on your keyboard to proceed when prompted while the environment is created. 
   
8. The environment is now created. In the same command prompt, you can use "conda activate <name>" to turn it on and "conda deactivate" to turn it off.
